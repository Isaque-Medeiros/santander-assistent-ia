# A Practical Guide to Spec-Driven Development

Spec-Driven Development (SDD) is a methodology that transforms how we work with AI coding agents by treating them as literal-minded but highly capable pair programmers who excel when given explicit, detailed instructions.

This guide uses a real-world example throughout – building a production-ready notification system – to demonstrate the dramatic difference between traditional prompting and spec-driven development. By the end, you'll understand not just the "what" but the "how" and "why" of this powerful approach.

## The Evolution: From Vibe-Coding to Systematic Development

### The Problem with Traditional Prompting

When AI coding agents first emerged, we treated them like search engines – type a query, get code back. This "vibe-coding" approach works great for quick prototypes, but it breaks down when building serious, mission-critical applications.

Consider this typical interaction:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Traditional Prompting Cycle (Click to Expand)">
    **Round 1:**

    ```
    Human: Add a notification system to my app
    AI: Here's a basic notification component with toast messages...
    ```

    **Round 2:**

    ```
    Human: No, I need backend notifications for order updates
    AI: Here's a simple email notification service...
    ```

    **Round 3:**

    ```
    Human: It needs to support SMS too, and users should control preferences
    AI: Let me add an SMS provider and a preferences model...
    ```

    **Round 4:**

    ```
    Human: What about retry logic? And we need delivery tracking
    AI: Adding exponential backoff and a delivery status table...
    ```

    And so it continues...
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Each iteration loses context from previous discussions. The agent makes reasonable assumptions that turn out wrong. You spend more time correcting course than building features.

### Enter Spec-Driven Development

Spec-driven development flips this model. Instead of iterative discovery, you provide comprehensive specifications upfront. Your AI agent receives a complete picture of what to build, why it matters, and critically – what NOT to build.

<CardGroup cols={2}>

    * Iterative discovery
    * Multiple corrections needed

    * Upfront clarity
    * Single source of truth
    * Persistent context
    * Tailored implementations
    * Predictable outcomes
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Why SDD Works in Production Environments

In established codebases, simple prompting often produces code that technically works but doesn't fit. The AI might choose different state management than your existing patterns, recreate functionality that already exists, or miss compliance requirements that aren't explicitly stated.

Spec-driven development addresses this by front-loading context. Your specification becomes the complete picture—not just what to build, but how it should integrate with existing systems, what patterns to follow, and what constraints to respect. This is especially critical in brownfield environments where implicit knowledge matters as much as explicit requirements.

## The Four Phases of Spec-Driven Development

<Steps>
  <Step title="Specify">
    Define what you're building from the user's perspective, including success criteria and constraints
  </Step>

  <Step title="Plan">
    Create a technical architecture that respects your existing codebase and constraints
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tasks">
    Break down the implementation into discrete, testable units of work
  </Step>

  <Step title="Implement">
    Execute against the plan with continuous validation against specifications
  </Step>
</Steps>

Let's walk through each phase using a real example: building a production-ready notification system for an e-commerce platform.

## Our Example: Real-Time Notification System

Throughout this guide, we'll build a notification system with these requirements:

* Multi-channel delivery (email, SMS, in-app)
* User preference management
* Retry logic with exponential backoff
* Delivery tracking and analytics
* Real-time updates

## Phase 1: Specify – Creating Your North Star

The specification is your contract with the AI agent. It defines success in user terms, not technical jargon.

### Generating Your Specification

Start by asking your AI agent:

```text  theme={"system"}
Create a comprehensive specification for [feature name] that includes:
- User story and stakeholders
- Measurable success criteria  
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Explicit constraints (what NOT to build)
- Technical context and integration points
- Acceptance tests

Be specific enough that another developer could implement without clarification.
```

### Traditional Approach

```text  theme={"system"}
"Build a notification system for order updates"
```

This seems clear to you because you have context. But the AI agent must guess at dozens of implicit requirements.

### Spec-Driven Approach

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Specification">
    ```markdown  theme={"system"}
    # Order Notification System Specification

    ## User Story
    As a customer, I want to receive timely updates about my order status through my preferred communication channels, so I can stay informed without constantly checking the website.

    ## Stakeholders
    - **Primary**: E-commerce customers (50K daily active users)
    - **Secondary**: Customer service team (reduce support tickets by 40%)
    - **Tertiary**: Operations team (monitor delivery performance)

    ## Success Criteria
    1. **Delivery Speed**: 95% of notifications delivered within 60 seconds
    2. **Reliability**: 99.9% successful delivery rate (after retries)
    3. **Preference Compliance**: 100% adherence to user channel preferences
    4. **Support Impact**: 40% reduction in "where's my order" tickets

    ## Functional Requirements

    ### Multi-Channel Support
    - Email notifications via SendGrid
    - SMS notifications via Twilio
    - In-app notifications via WebSocket
    - Each channel independently toggleable

    ### Notification Types
    1. Order confirmed
    2. Payment processed
    3. Order shipped (with tracking)
    4. Out for delivery
    5. Delivered
    6. Delivery failed
    7. Refund initiated
    8. Refund completed

    ### User Preferences
    - Global on/off switch
    - Per-channel toggles
    - Per-notification-type preferences
    - Quiet hours (no SMS between 10 PM - 8 AM)
    - Language preference (English, Spanish, French)

    ### Retry Logic
    - 3 retry attempts for failed deliveries
    - Exponential backoff: 1 min, 5 min, 15 min
    - Different strategies per channel
    - Dead letter queue after final failure

    ### Analytics Requirements
    - Track delivery rate per channel
    - Track open/click rates for email
    - Track user preference changes
    - Monitor retry patterns
    - Alert on delivery degradation

    ## Non-Functional Requirements

    ### Performance
    - Handle 10,000 concurrent notifications
    - 60-second end-to-end delivery SLA
    - No more than 100ms API response time

    ### Security
    - PII data encryption at rest
    - Secure token generation for unsubscribe links
    - Rate limiting per user (max 50 notifications/day)

    ### Compliance
    - CAN-SPAM compliant unsubscribe mechanism
    - TCPA compliance for SMS
    - GDPR-compliant data handling

    ## Explicit Constraints (DO NOT)
    - Do NOT implement push notifications (Phase 2)
    - Do NOT build a custom email service (use SendGrid)
    - Do NOT modify the existing User model
    - Do NOT add social media notifications
    - Do NOT implement notification templates editing UI (admins will use code)
    - Do NOT create a separate notification service (embed in monolith)

    ## Technical Context
    - Existing stack: Next.js 14, PostgreSQL, Redis
    - Must integrate with existing OrderService
    - Must use existing authentication system
    - Must respect current API versioning (v2)

    ## Acceptance Tests
    1. User can enable/disable individual channels
    2. Notification arrives within 60 seconds of trigger
    3. Failed notifications retry with correct backoff
    4. Quiet hours are respected for SMS
    5. Unsubscribe link works without authentication
    6. Analytics dashboard shows real-time metrics
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Why This Works">
    This specification succeeds because it:

    1. **Starts with users**: Who needs this and why?
    2. **Defines measurable success**: Concrete metrics, not vague goals
    3. **Lists explicit constraints**: What NOT to build is as important
    4. **Provides context**: Existing systems and limitations
    5. **Includes acceptance criteria**: Clear validation requirements
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip**: Your specification should be detailed enough that another developer could implement it without asking clarifying questions. If you find yourself explaining things during implementation, add those clarifications to the spec for next time.
</Tip>

## Phase 2: Plan – From Vision to Architecture

With a clear specification, your AI agent can create a comprehensive technical plan that considers your entire ecosystem.

### Setting Up the Planning Phase

In Zencoder, you'll leverage the [Coding Agent](/features/coding-agent) with [Repo Grokking™](/technologies/repo-grokking) to understand your existing codebase:

```text  theme={"system"}
Based on the specification above, create a technical implementation plan.
Consider our existing services and patterns. 
Identify integration points and potential conflicts.
```

    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  Notice how the plan respects our constraints: no push notifications, uses existing services, maintains API versioning.
</Note>

## Phase 3: Tasks – Breaking Down the Mountain

With architecture defined, we decompose the implementation into manageable, testable chunks.

### Generating the Task List

```text  theme={"system"}
Break down the implementation into discrete tasks.
Each task should be:
- Independently implementable
- Testable in isolation  
- Reviewable as a single PR
```

### The Task Breakdown

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Database Setup" icon="database">
    * Create migration for notification\_preferences table
    * Create migration for notification\_type\_preferences table
    * Create migration for notification\_log table
    * Add indexes and constraints
    * Seed with test data
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Core Models" icon="cube">
    * Implement NotificationPreference model
    * Implement NotificationTypePreference model
    * Implement NotificationLog model
    * Add Zod schemas for validation
    * Create TypeScript types
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Preference Manager" icon="sliders">
    * Build PreferenceManager service
    * Implement preference cascade logic
    * Add quiet hours checking
    * Create preference caching layer
    * Write preference API endpoints
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provider Implementations" icon="plug">
    * Create abstract NotificationProvider class
    * Implement EmailProvider with SendGrid
    * Implement SMSProvider with Twilio
    * Implement WebSocketProvider
    * Add provider health checks
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Queue System" icon="layer-group">
    * Set up Redis queue structure
    * Implement NotificationQueue class
    * Build QueueProcessor with retry logic
    * Add exponential backoff
    * Create dead letter queue handler
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Integration Layer" icon="link">
    * Hook into OrderService events
    * Create notification triggers
    * Map order events to notification types
    * Add event validation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Analytics & Monitoring" icon="chart-line">
    * Build analytics aggregation service
    * Create delivery rate calculations
    * Implement real-time metrics
    * Add performance monitoring
    * Set up alerting thresholds
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Testing Suite" icon="vial">
    * Unit tests for each provider
    * Integration tests for queue system
    * E2E tests for notification flow
    * Load tests for 10K concurrent notifications
    * Compliance validation tests

    Each test validates against specification acceptance criteria. This creates automatic guardrails—if the implementation deviates from requirements, tests fail. Test-driven development keeps the agent aligned with specifications throughout implementation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  **Using Zencoder**: Each task becomes a conversation with your [Coding Agent](/features/coding-agent). The agent maintains context across tasks through the specification and plan, ensuring consistency.
</Tip>

## Phase 4: Implement – Guided Execution with Validation

Now we implement each task, with the AI agent having full context of specifications, architecture, and dependencies.

With specifications defining requirements, tests providing guardrails, and a technical plan establishing architecture, Phase 4 implementation becomes significantly more autonomous. The agent can execute with confidence while you shift attention to planning the next feature. Verification catches deviations automatically, eliminating the need for constant supervision.

### Traditional vs. Spec-Driven Implementation

Let's implement the EmailProvider to see the difference:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Traditional Prompt">
    ```text  theme={"system"}
    Human: Implement an email notification provider
    ```

    The agent might generate:

    ```typescript  theme={"system"}
    class EmailProvider {
      async send(to: string, subject: string, body: string) {
        // Generic implementation
        await sendEmail(to, subject, body);
      }
    }
    ```

    This is technically correct but misses:

    * Error handling strategy
    * Retry logic integration
    * Analytics tracking
    * Template system
    * Unsubscribe links
    * Compliance requirements
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Spec-Driven Implementation">
    With full context, the agent generates:

    ```typescript  theme={"system"}
    import { NotificationProvider, DeliveryResult, NotificationPayload } from '@/lib/notifications/types';
    import { sendGridClient } from '@/lib/email/client';
    import { generateUnsubscribeToken } from '@/lib/auth/tokens';
    import { trackEmailEvent } from '@/lib/analytics';
    import { NotificationLog } from '@/models/notification-log';
    import { templates } from '@/lib/notifications/templates';

    export class EmailProvider extends NotificationProvider {
      readonly channel = 'email' as const;
      readonly maxRetries = 3;
      readonly retryDelays = [60000, 300000, 900000]; // 1min, 5min, 15min
      
      async validate(payload: NotificationPayload): Promise<boolean> {
        // Validate email address format
        const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
        if (!emailRegex.test(payload.recipient.email)) {
          throw new Error(`Invalid email address: ${payload.recipient.email}`);
        }

        const missingFields = template.requiredFields.filter(
          field => !payload.data[field]
        );
        if (missingFields.length > 0) {
          throw new Error(`Missing required fields: ${missingFields.join(', ')}`);
        }
        
        return true;
      }
      
      async send(
        payload: NotificationPayload,
        attemptNumber: number = 1
      ): Promise<DeliveryResult> {
        const startTime = Date.now();
        
        try {
          // Validate before sending
          await this.validate(payload);
          
          // Generate unsubscribe token (CAN-SPAM compliance)
          const unsubscribeToken = await generateUnsubscribeToken(
            payload.recipient.id,
            'email'
          );
          
          // Prepare email content
          const template = templates[payload.type];
          const html = await template.render({

          });
          
          // Add tracking pixel for analytics
          const trackingPixel = `<img src="${process.env.APP_URL}/api/v2/track/email/${payload.id}" width="1" height="1" />`;
          const htmlWithTracking = html.replace('</body>', `${trackingPixel}</body>`);
          
          // Send via SendGrid

        }
        
        // Invalid recipient, template errors are not retryable
        if (error.response?.statusCode >= 400 && error.response?.statusCode < 500) {
          return false;
        }
        
        // Default to retryable for unknown errors
        return true;
      }
      
      async checkHealth(): Promise<boolean> {
        try {
          // Verify SendGrid API key is valid
          await sendGridClient.request({
            method: 'GET',
            url: '/v3/scopes'
          });
          return true;
        } catch {
          return false;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The spec-driven implementation includes everything from the specification:

* Compliance features (unsubscribe links, CAN-SPAM)
* Analytics tracking
* Retry logic coordination
* Error classification
* Template system
* Health monitoring

<Note>
  **The Zencoder Advantage**: With [Multi-Repository Search](/features/multi-repo), the agent knew about your existing `sendGridClient`, `trackEmailEvent`, and other utilities inside other repos without being told. It followed your system's patterns automatically.
</Note>

### Verification: The Industrial-Grade Safety Net

Specifications without verification are just documentation. The power of spec-driven development comes from continuous validation:

**Test-Driven Guardrails**
Each acceptance criterion in your specification becomes a test case. As the agent implements:

1. Tests validate correctness against spec requirements
2. Failures indicate deviation from specifications
3. Success confirms alignment with intended behavior

This verification layer transforms AI coding from "hope it works" to "prove it works."

**Example from our notification system:**

```typescript  theme={"system"}
// Specification says: "95% of notifications delivered within 60 seconds"
describe('EmailProvider delivery speed', () => {
  it('delivers within 60 seconds at 95th percentile', async () => {
    const deliveryTimes = await measureDeliveryTimes(1000);
    const p95 = percentile(deliveryTimes, 95);
    expect(p95).toBeLessThan(60000); // 60 seconds
  });
});

// Specification says: "Respect quiet hours for SMS"  
describe('SMSProvider quiet hours', () => {
  it('queues SMS during quiet hours', async () => {
    setTime('23:00'); // 11 PM
    await notificationService.trigger(smsNotification);
    expect(immediatelySent).toBe(false);
    expect(queuedFor).toBe('08:00');
  });
});
```

Without these guardrails, the agent might implement retry logic that "looks right" but uses the wrong intervals, or add quiet hours that check the wrong timezone.

## Implementing in Zencoder: Practical Workflow

Now let's set up your Zencoder environment for spec-driven development.

### Step 1: Organize Your Specifications

Create a dedicated structure for your specifications:

```bash  theme={"system"}
project-root/
├── .zencoder/
│   ├── specs/           # Your specifications
│   │   ├── notifications.md
│   │   ├── authentication.md
│   │   └── payment-processing.md
│   ├── plans/           # Technical plans
│   │   └── notifications-plan.md
│   └── rules/           # Zen Rules for consistency
│       └── sdd-standards.md
```

### Step 2: Configure Zen Rules for SDD

Create a Zen Rules file to enforce spec-driven patterns:

```markdown  theme={"system"}
---
description: "Spec-driven development standards"
alwaysApply: true
---

# Spec-Driven Development Standards

## Before Implementation
1. Always check for an existing specification in `.zencoder/specs/`
2. If no spec exists, request one before proceeding
3. Validate implementation plans against specifications

## During Implementation
1. Each file should reference its governing specification
2. Use specification acceptance criteria as test cases
3. Flag any deviations from spec as "SPEC_DEVIATION: [reason]"  

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Implementation matches specification requirements
- [ ] All explicit constraints (DO NOTs) are respected
- [ ] Acceptance criteria have corresponding tests
- [ ] Performance requirements are validated
- [ ] Security requirements are implemented
```

### Step 3: Initialize Your Agent Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Project Context">
    Use the [Repo-Info Agent](/features/repo-info-agent) to create comprehensive project context:

    ```text  theme={"system"}
    /repo-info
    Generate a comprehensive analysis including architecture patterns,
    dependencies, and coding conventions
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start with Specification">
    Open the [Coding Agent](/features/coding-agent) and provide your specification:

    ```text  theme={"system"}
    Here's the specification for our notification system:
    [paste specification]

    Please review and identify any clarifications needed before we proceed.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate the Plan">
    ```text  theme={"system"}
    Based on the specification and our codebase analysis, create a 
    technical implementation plan including architecture, database 
    schema, and integration points.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Task List">
    ```text  theme={"system"}
    Break down the implementation into discrete, testable tasks.
    Each task should be a single PR worth of work.
    Include time estimates and dependencies.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Implement Tasks">
    For each task:

    ```text  theme={"system"}
    Implement [Task Name] according to the specification and plan.
    Reference: `.zencoder/specs/notifications.md` section [X]
    Acceptance criteria: [list from spec]
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 4: Leverage Multi-Agent Collaboration

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Unit Testing Agent" icon="vial">
    Generate tests directly from specifications:

    ```text  theme={"system"}
    Generate unit tests for EmailProvider based on these acceptance criteria:
    - Notifications delivered within 60 seconds
    - Failed sends retry with exponential backoff
    - Unsubscribe links included in all emails
    ```

    [Link to Unit Testing Agent](/features/unit-testing)
  </Card>

  <Card title="E2E Testing Agent" icon="browser">
    Validate complete user flows:

    ```text  theme={"system"}
    Create E2E tests for the notification preference flow:
    1. User disables SMS notifications
    2. Order status changes
    3. Verify only email and in-app notifications sent
    ```

    [Link to E2E Testing Agent](/features/e2e-testing)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Working Across Multiple Sessions

Spec-driven development truly shines in long-running tasks that span multiple coding sessions.

### State Management Strategy

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Progress Tracking">
    Create a `progress.md` file that your agent updates:

    ```markdown  theme={"system"}
    # Notification System Implementation Progress

    ## Completed Tasks
    - [x] Database migrations (PR #234)
    - [x] Core models (PR #235)
    - [x] PreferenceManager service (PR #236)
    - [x] EmailProvider implementation (PR #237)

    ## Current Task
    - [ ] SMSProvider implementation
      - Twilio client configured
      - Basic send method complete
      - TODO: Add retry logic
      - TODO: Add quiet hours check

    ## Upcoming Tasks
    - [ ] WebSocketProvider
    - [ ] Queue processor
    - [ ] Analytics dashboard

    ## Blockers
    - Waiting for Twilio API credentials from DevOps

    ## Notes for Next Session
    - SMS provider needs special handling for international numbers
    - Consider adding provider circuit breaker pattern
    - Performance test results: current implementation handles 5K/sec
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Test Status Tracking">
    Maintain a `test-status.json` for systematic validation:

    ```json  theme={"system"}
    {
      "specVersion": "1.2.0",
      "lastUpdated": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "acceptanceCriteria": {
        "delivery_speed": {
          "requirement": "95% within 60 seconds",
          "status": "passing",
          "metrics": {
            "p95": 45.3,
            "p99": 58.2
          }
        },
        "retry_logic": {
          "requirement": "3 retries with exponential backoff",
          "status": "passing",
          "tests": [
            "email_retry_test.ts",
            "sms_retry_test.ts"
          ]
        },
        "quiet_hours": {
          "requirement": "No SMS between 10 PM - 8 AM",
          "status": "in_progress",
          "notes": "Timezone handling needs work"
        },
        "unsubscribe": {
          "requirement": "One-click unsubscribe without auth",
          "status": "passing",
          "compliance": "CAN-SPAM verified"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Better Code Review Through Structure

Spec-driven development fundamentally improves code review. Instead of reviewing scattered changes across multiple files and reverse-engineering the developer's intent, reviewers follow a clear path:

**Traditional AI-Generated PR:**

* 10 files changed across different concerns
* Unclear which changes address which requirements
* Reviewer must mentally reconstruct the feature
* Easy to miss edge cases or requirement deviations

**Spec-Driven PR:**

* Each PR maps to a specific task from the breakdown
* Task links to relevant specification section
* Reviewer validates: "Does this implementation satisfy the spec requirements?"
* Tests prove acceptance criteria are met

This top-down review process—specification → plan → task → implementation—keeps humans meaningfully in the loop while AI handles execution.

<Tip>
  **Model Selection Matters**: Different AI models have different strengths. For example, we've found that Claude Sonnet 4.5 excels at state management and maintaining context across long sessions. Experiment with different models for different phases of development. [Read our Sonnet 4.5 review](https://zencoder.ai/blog/sonnet-4-5-review-first-spec-driven-model) to learn more about model-specific capabilities.
</Tip>

### Resuming Work

When starting a new session:

```text  theme={"system"}
Review the progress in progress.md and test-status.json.
Check git log for recent changes.
Continue with the current task, maintaining consistency with completed work.
```

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip**: Commit your progress file and test status with each PR. This creates a historical record of implementation decisions and helps onboard team members quickly.
</Tip>

## When to Use Each Approach

Not every coding task needs full specification. Here's your decision framework:

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Patterns for Success

### Pattern 1: Living Specifications

Your specifications should evolve with your understanding:

```markdown  theme={"system"}
# Specification Version History

## v1.2.0 (Current)
- Added requirement for SMS quiet hours
- Clarified retry backoff intervals
- Added language preference support

## v1.1.0
- Added analytics requirements
- Specified performance targets

## v1.0.0
- Initial specification
```

### Pattern 2: Specification Templates

Create templates for common features:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API Feature Template">
    ```markdown  theme={"system"}
    # [Feature Name] API Specification

    ## Endpoints
    - Method, path, description
    - Request/response schemas
    - Error codes

    ## Authentication
    - Required permissions
    - Rate limiting

    ## Performance Requirements
    - Response time targets
    - Throughput requirements

    ## Security Considerations
    - Data validation
    - Audit logging
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Background Job Template">
    ```markdown  theme={"system"}
    # [Job Name] Background Job Specification

    ## Trigger Conditions
    - Schedule or events

    ## Processing Logic
    - Step-by-step algorithm
    - Error handling

    ## Idempotency
    - How to handle retries

    ## Monitoring
    - Success/failure metrics
    - Alerting thresholds
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Pattern 3: Test-Driven Specifications

Include test scenarios in your specifications:

```markdown  theme={"system"}
## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
Given: User has all channels enabled
When: Order status changes to "shipped"
Then: Email, SMS, and in-app notifications sent within 60 seconds

### Edge Case: Quiet Hours
Given: Current time is 11 PM, user has SMS enabled
When: Order delivered notification triggered
Then: Email and in-app sent immediately, SMS queued for 8 AM

### Error Case: Provider Failure
Given: SendGrid API returns 500 error
When: Email notification attempted
Then: Retry after 1 minute, then 5 minutes, then 15 minutes
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

<Warning>
  **Common Pitfalls in Spec-Driven Development**

  * **Over-Specifying Implementation Details**: Specify what, not how
  * **Under-Specifying Edge Cases**: Think through error scenarios
  * **Ignoring Existing Patterns**: Respect your codebase conventions
  * **Skipping the Planning Phase**: Architecture matters
  * **Not Updating Specs**: Keep them living documents
</Warning>

## Establishing Reproducible Development Processes

One challenge with AI-assisted development is the wide variation in individual developers' prompting skills and AI experience. A senior developer who knows how to prompt effectively might achieve 3x productivity, while a junior developer struggles with the same tools.

Spec-driven development creates a standardized process that works regardless of individual AI expertise. The methodology is embedded in the specifications and workflow, not dependent on each developer's ability to craft the perfect prompt. This democratizes AI productivity across your organization:

* Junior developers follow the same spec → plan → tasks → implement flow as senior developers
* Code quality remains consistent because requirements and verification are explicit
* Knowledge lives in specifications and tests, not in individuals' prompting techniques
* Teams can scale AI-assisted development without scaling AI expertise

The result is a unified approach to development that produces predictable, high-quality outcomes across your entire engineering organization.

## Getting Started: Your First Spec-Driven Feature

Ready to try spec-driven development? Start with a small, self-contained feature:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a Feature">
    Pick something with:

    * Clear user value
    * 3-5 day implementation
    * Minimal external dependencies
    * Defined success criteria
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write Your First Specification">
    Use this minimal template:

    ```markdown  theme={"system"}
    # [Feature] Specification

    ## User Story
    As a [user type], I want [capability], so that [benefit]

    ## Success Criteria
    1. [Measurable outcome]
    2. [Measurable outcome]

    ## Requirements
    - [Functional requirement]
    - [Functional requirement]

    ## Constraints
    - Do NOT [constraint]
    - Must use [existing system]
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Plan with Zencoder">
    Open [Coding Agent](/features/coding-agent):

    ```text  theme={"system"}
    Create a technical plan for this specification.
    Consider our existing codebase and patterns.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Implement and Iterate">
    Work through tasks systematically, updating your specification as you learn.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Looking Forward

Spec-driven development isn't just about writing better prompts—it's about fundamentally changing how we collaborate with AI coding agents. By treating them as highly capable but literal-minded partners who excel with clear direction, we unlock their true potential.

The examples in this guide demonstrate that the additional upfront investment in specifications pays dividends throughout implementation:

* Fewer iterations and corrections
* Better alignment with requirements
* More maintainable code
* Comprehensive test coverage
* Living documentation

As AI agents become more sophisticated, the ability to precisely specify what we want becomes even more valuable. The agents gain capabilities, but they still need clear direction to apply those capabilities effectively.

<Note>
  **Remember**: Spec-driven development and traditional prompting aren't mutually exclusive. Use the right tool for the job. Quick fixes and explorations benefit from conversational prompting, while production features deserve the rigor of specifications.
</Note>
